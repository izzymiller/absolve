Add absolve.ts, test_absolve.ts, and leaf.svg to your action hub in the /src/actions/absolve directory (You will need to create the absolve directory there).
Make sure to also add ```import "./absolve/absolve"``` to /src/actions/index.ts.

Tests are still WIP but to satisfy Looker's action hub requirements, there is a test_absolve.ts that doesn't do much of anything. (I know, I know, test-driven-development, I'm sorry.)
