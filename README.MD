*Absolve* is a combination of a Looker block, a Looker Action, and a Google Cloud Function that together let you visualize your company's carbon footprint using a Looker dashboard, purchase carbon offsets directly from that same dashboard, and ultimately visualize those offsets in real time. 

It was created using an ecommerce dataset and calculates the carbon emissions of shipping orders from distribution centers to user locations. No factors are taken into consideration besides:
Item weight
Item distance shipped
Item shipping method

I would love for it to one day include more robust CO2e calculationsâ€” PR welcome!

The block likely won't work for your dataset immediately out of the box.
