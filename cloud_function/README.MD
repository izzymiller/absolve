This is the module that speaks to [Cloverly](https://cloverly.com) and pipes the data back into Bigquery.

This module is entirely optionalâ€” But you won't be able to visualize your offset information in Looker without it. 

To set it up, you'll need to:

1. Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket (I named mine carbon_bucket)
2. Add that bucket name to the action settings from the Looker admin panel 
3. Install the gcloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install
4. Deploy the cloud function. Using the MacOS gcloud SDK, I run ```gcloud beta functions deploy refresh_offset_data --runtime python37 --trigger-http --set-env-vars CL_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_cloverly_API_key_here>```
